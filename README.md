## Summary

Week 10 proposed exercise
Use Rails to mashup data from StLouis Federal Reserve (economic data) and/or Quandl (stock price data)

### Problem

* St Louis Federal reserve has lots of economic data timeseries available for free on API
http://api.stlouisfed.org/docs/fred/
* Quandl appears to have this data and a lot more available in a standardaised API call
https://www.quandl.com/help/api

Can we
* Show a table of historical stock returns for a single stock
* Show a stock price history chart of a simple stock (google charts?)
* Compare a stock return to an index?
* Show the return of an unchanging portfolio of stocks? 
* extend this to some other portfolio management problems which work with end of day data?

does the Quandl ruby gem make accessing the API easier?
